                Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only

                Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"),
                "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as

                third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve
                the user experience which may result in said third parties also
                processing data they collect and control.

              <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>

              <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
              <p>
                With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
                below, users and data subjects have the right
              </p>
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                  to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being
                  processed, information about the data being processed, further
                  information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of
                  the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
                </li>
                <li>
                  to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
                  16 GDPR);
                </li>
                <li>
                  to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art.
                  17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary
                  as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing
                  per Art. 18 GDPR;
                </li>
                <li>
                  to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
                  them and to have the same transmitted to other
                  providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
                </li>
                <li>
                  to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
                  that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
                  breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).

              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to
                whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
                restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1,
                18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such
                notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
                Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these
                recipients.

                <strong
                  >Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the
                  right to object to the controller's future processing of their
                  data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an
                  objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising
                  is permissible.</strong

              <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
              <p>
                Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or
                blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply,
                provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory
                storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
              </p>
              <h4>Server data</h4>
              <p>
                For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet
                browser to us or to our server provider will be collected,
                especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log
                files record the type and version of your browser, operating system,
                the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our
                site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP
                address from which you visited our site.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in
                association with any other of your data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
                legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability,
                functionality, and security of our website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless
                continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which
                case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until
                the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
              </p>
              <h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
              <p>
                We also integrate the following social media sites into our website.
                The integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective
                site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents
                the automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their
                display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be
                forwarded to the service of the respective social network.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you click, that network may record information about you and
                your visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will
                be processed in the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the
                date and time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged
                into your user account on that network, however, the network
                operator might assign the information collected about your visit to
                our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like,
                Share, etc., this information can be stored your personal user
                account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent
                this, you need to log out of your social media account before
                clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks also
                offer settings that you can configure accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following social networks are integrated into our site by linked
                graphics:

                  >www.etracker.com</a

                The data generated by etracker on behalf of the provider of this

                legitimate interest is the optimisation of our online offer and our
