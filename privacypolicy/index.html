          <p>
            Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only
            be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of
            providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its
            contents, and the services offered there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data
            Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"),
            "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as
            collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage,
            adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
            transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available,
            alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction
            performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular
            about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the
            processing of such data either under our own control or in
            conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the
            third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve
            the user experience which may result in said third parties also
            processing data they collect and control.
          </p>
          <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
          <p>
            I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br />II. The
            rights of users and data subjects<br />III. Information about the
            data processing
          </p>
          <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
          <p>
            The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for
            purposes of data protection law is:

          </p>
          
          <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
          <p>
            With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
            below, users and data subjects have the right
          </p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being
              processed, information about the data being processed, further
              information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of
              the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
            </li>
            <li>
              to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
              16 GDPR);
            </li>
            <li>
              to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art.
              17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary
              as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing
              per Art. 18 GDPR;
            </li>
            <li>
              to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
              them and to have the same transmitted to other
              providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
            </li>
            <li>
              to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
              that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
              breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to
            whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
            restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1,
            18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such
            notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
            Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these
            recipients.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the
              right to object to the controller's future processing of their
              data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an
              objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising
              is permissible.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
          <p>
            Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or
            blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply,
            provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory
            storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
          </p>
          <h4>Server data</h4>
          <p>
            For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet
            browser to us or to our server provider will be collected,
            especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log
            files record the type and version of your browser, operating system,
            the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our
            site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP
            address from which you visited our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in
            association with any other of your data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
            legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability,
            functionality, and security of our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless
            continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which
            case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until
            the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
          </p>
          <h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
          <p>
            We also integrate the following social media sites into our website.
            The integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective
            site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents
            the automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their
            display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be
            forwarded to the service of the respective social network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you click, that network may record information about you and
            your visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will
            be processed in the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the
            date and time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged
            into your user account on that network, however, the network
            operator might assign the information collected about your visit to
            our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like,
            Share, etc., this information can be stored your personal user
            account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent
            this, you need to log out of your social media account before
            clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks also
            offer settings that you can configure accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following social networks are integrated into our site by linked
            graphics:

          <p>
            We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics
            service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
            Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is
            used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
            interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation
            of our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time,
            or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a
            Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use
            Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby
            Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it
            is transmitted to the US.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide
            us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do
            once there. This data can also be used to provide other services
            related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other
            data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard
            to its data protection practices at

            data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on
            informs Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information
            about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics.
            However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to
            us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.

          <h4>Google-Maps</h4>
